"""
Application startup initialization.

Phase 1 Performance Optimization: Initializes shared resources once at startup
following LangGraph patterns for resource management and lifespan events.

This eliminates the 25-50% performance overhead caused by:
- Repeated config.ini loading (40-300ms per turn)
- Client recreation per turn (150-600ms per turn) 
- Authentication setup redundancy (100-500ms per turn)
